  # - For 'rackup', the rackup script you provide as an inline string
  #   is simply embedded in web.xml.
  # The script is evaluated in a Rack::Builder to load the application.

  # config.webxml.rackup.path = 'WEB-INF/hello.ru'
  # config.webxml.rackup = %{require './lib/demo'; run Rack::Adapter::Camping.new(Demo)}
  # config.webxml.rackup = require 'cgi' && CGI::escapeHTML(File.read("config.ru"))
